GitHub is important for Software Quality Assurance because it provides a centralized platform
to store and manage QA artifacts such as test cases, test reports, and documentation.

Version control helps teamwork by allowing multiple QA engineers to work on the same project
simultaneously without overwriting each other’s work. Each change is recorded through commits,
which improves coordination and accountability.

Traceability improves software quality by maintaining a complete history of changes. It allows
QA teams to track who made changes, when changes were made, and why they were made, which
helps in audits, defect analysis, and continuous improvement.
